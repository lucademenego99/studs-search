# studs-search

studs-search is an Enterprise JavaBeans application exploiting WildFly, Hibernate, Java Servlets and an H2 database. It has been implemented as an exercise for the Web Architectures Master's Course in CS, whose assignment and report can be found in the folder `docs/`.

The user interface has been first prepared using Figma, following the neumorphism trend.
